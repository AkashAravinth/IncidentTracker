# Incident Tracker Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to build an incident tracking application with React frontend, FastAPI backend, SQLite database, containerized with Docker, and deployed on AWS.

## Database Schema
- Id: SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
- Title: VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL
- Desc: TEXT
- Status: VARCHAR(50) CHECK(status IN ('Open','In_Progress','Resolved')) DEFAULT 'Open'
- Priority: VARCHAR(50) CHECK(priority IN ('Low','Medium','High')) DEFAULT 'Medium'
- Created_at: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- Updated_at: TIMESTAMP

## Todo List
- [^] Define and finalize database schema with correct constraints
- [^] Set up backend project structure with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
- [^] Implement database models.
- [^] Add basic authentication (username/password) to backend
- [^] Create API endpoints for incident CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- [^] Implement filtering by status and sorting by creation date in listing endpoint
- [^] Set up frontend project with React
- [^] Implement authentication in frontend
- [^] Create incident listing page with filter and sort functionality
- [^] Create incident create page
- [^] Create incident edit page
- [^] Add delete functionality to listing page
- [^] Create Dockerfile for backend
- [^] Create Dockerfile for frontend
- [^] Create Dockerfile for database (SQLite)
- [^] Create docker-compose.yml for local development
- [^] Test the application locally with Docker
- [ ] Set up AWS infrastructure (EC2, RDS if needed, but since SQLite, maybe just EC2)
- [ ] Deploy application to AWS
- [ ] Configure production settings and security

## Architecture
- Frontend: React (Docker container)
- Backend: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM (Docker container)
- Database: SQLite (Docker container)
- Deployment: AWS (EC2 instances or ECS)

## Features
- Incident management: Create, list, edit, delete
- Authentication: Basic username/password
- Filtering: By status
- Sorting: By creation date

## FrontEnd Project Structure
- node_modules: contains all installed npm packages and dependencies.
- public: this is meant to serve the static assets
    - index.html: The main HTML template where the React app is mounted.
    - favicon.ico: favicon is the icon whihc we can see on the tab present in the browser.
    - logo192.png, logo512.png: Icons for the PWA (Progressive Web App), so these Icon can be used if the app is placed in the home screen.
        - A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a type of web application built using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that delivers an app-like experience to users directly through a web browser. PWAs combine the best features of web and native mobile apps, offering benefits such as fast loading, offline access, push notifications and responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.
    - manifest.json: configuring how the app appears when launched from a home screen.
    - robots.txt: A robots.txt file is a simple text file placed in the root directory of a website that serves as a communication tool between the site owner and web crawlers (bots) like Googlebot or Bingbot. Its primary purpose is to control and manage how these crawlers access and index the website's content.  The file contains specific instructions, written in a standardized syntax, telling web crawlers which pages or sections of a website they are allowed to visit and index, and which parts they must ignore or avoid
- src: Source code for the react app:
    - App.css: Styles for the main App component.
    - Main App component (entry point for routing and layout).
    - App.test.js:  Test file for App component.
    - index.css: Global styles.
    - index.js:: Entry point that renders the App into the DOM.
    - reportwebvitals.js: For measuring performance.
    - setupTests.js: Configuration for testing.
    - components: for the reusable react components.
    - pages: this has the main pages.
        - Home.js: A simple home page component.
    - services: for API calls and data handling.
        - api.js: for API calls to the backend.
    - utils: it has the helper functions.
- .gitignore
- package.json:  Defines project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
    - The package.json for the React frontend should be placed in the frontend/ directory (not the root) to maintain clear separation and best practices in a multi-service project.
    -  The backend uses Python (with requirements.txt for pip), while the frontend uses JavaScript/Node.js (with package.json for npm/yarn). Keeping them in their respective directories avoids mixing incompatible dependency managers and environments.
- package-lock.json: The file package-lock.json is automatically generated by the Node Package Manager (npm) when you install or update dependencies in a Node.js project. Its main purpose is to lock down the exact versions of every dependency and sub-dependency that your project uses.
